# Find IP Address

In this class, you'll learn how to find IP address using python                                                            


## Prerequisites:

1.  <b> Python Basics </b>
2.  <b> socket module </b>

### What is IP address?

**[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)** stands for Internet Protocol address, is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a **[computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)** that uses the **[Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol)** for communication.

IP (Internet Protocol) Address is an address of your network hardware. An IP Address is made up of numbers or characters. All devices that are connected to an internet connection have a unique IP address

There are two IP versions:

* IPv4
* IPv6

There are a few other types of IP addresses as well like private IP addresses, public IP addresses, static IP addresses and dynamic IP addresses.

---
## Install Necessary Modules:

Since **`socket`** is an in-built module, hence no need to install it separately.

## Frequently asked questions ‚ùî

### How can I thank you for writing and sharing this tutorial? üå∑

You can <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%AD%90 Star &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Star Badge"/> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%B5%96 Fork &message=if%20useful&style=style=flat&color=blue" alt="Fork Badge"/> Starring and Forking is free for you, but it tells me and other people that it was helpful and you like this tutorial.

Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects) if you aren't here already and click ‚ûû **`‚ú∞ Star`** and **`‚µñ Fork`** button in the top right corner. You'll be asked to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="21" />

1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects) and click the big green ‚ûû **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ‚ûû [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

    ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects/blob/main/img/dnld_rep.png)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately, I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage of doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
