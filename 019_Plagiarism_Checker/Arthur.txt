Success can mean a variety of different things. Success is, quite simply, the accomplishment of a predetermined goal. To some people it could mean making money, cultivate and develop certain basic qualities, to others it could mean keeping everyone happy, but to me, it means achieving the goals and objective I have set for myself for my life. Besides working on your goals that would lead a person towards success it is very important to push your limit every day, take charge of your life, and keep learning. This experience enables us to think smartly to solve a critical problem and achieve success. It is very important to take care of your mind which could be done by eliminating negative thoughts and negative people from your life. I think in order to call something successful, both the result and the process should be great. Without success, you, the group, your company, your goals, dreams and even entire civilizations cease to survive.
